Key Focus Areas:


1.    NATURE BASED INTERVENTIONS – LAND USE CHANGE
Sustainable forest management - Managing and increasing tree cover: 
landscape protection - by monitoring the water, soil, and natural resources of fragile ecosystems, it is possible to decide on the best place to develop the land
land cover disturbance from fire, drought, or resource development 
deforestation, forest structure (height and volume) and biomass density monitoring
Managing and monitoring soil carbon: 
monitoring and assessing soil and peatland areas, including determining the status and condition of intact peatlands
estimating and monitoring soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. 
sustainable agricultural site planning, irrigation management, improved soil structure, increased soil biodiversity, better holding water capacity and nutrient availability.
Improving wildlife/ biodiversity: 
wildlife monitoring and ecosystem optimisation/re-organisation of areas that suffered ecosystem damage (e.g. due to flooding, fires etc.) 
forest management, land use planning including new infrastructures that might have a direct and in-direct impact on biodiversity disturbance  


2.    NATURE BASED INTERVENTIONS – WATER AND MARINE ENVIRONMENT
Managing freshwater and wetlands: 
monitoring aquaculture, protecting underwater ecosystems, monitoring infrastructure development, land conversion, water withdrawal, pollution, overharvesting and overexploitation of freshwater species
Managing the marine environment: 
monitoring seabed habitats and their condition (whether they are disturbed or not)
mapping the areas important for key ecosystem services such as carbon storage, fish habitat and recreation.
water management (water loss), hydrographic surveying and environmental monitoring analysis, maritime pollution detection and monitoring, emissions monitoring (SOx, CO2, etc)


3.    SATELLITE EARTH OBSERVATION (SATEO):
About ten types of Natural Capital in terms of amount and condition can be directly measured from space at national and site level: habitat type, habitat distribution, vegetation height, woody biomass, canopy structure, coastal forest/ mangrove degradation/ afforestation, annual primary productivity, above-ground carbon, water cycling, above-ground nitrogen.  
Earth Observation (EO) data can provide instrumental information for the identification of the best geographical sites for establishing new afforestation/ reforestation/ restoration sites, monitor on-going sequestration actions and support the evaluation of sequestrated carbon volume. Similarly, this data can contribute to identify safe sites for deploying carbon capture and underground storage facilities, detect potential issues such as leaks (via emissions detection or effect on vegetation monitoring) and contribute to total net emissions computations. 
Tree growth over time using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data (direct backscatter to look at biomass or looking at a more developed sort of internal metric techniques to determine parameters like heights). EO data can be used to create digital elevation model as well as land use and land cover maps to support hydrological calculations and classify forests.
